# Welcome to PlaceU!

Hi! This is a ***free*** and ***open source*** project based on online placements. **PlaceU** is a platform where students can apply for jobs, employers can post jobs, and college or university administrators can manage these profiles.

This is based on the problem statement provided by **[SkillValley](https://skillvalley.in/)**.

## Featureâœ¨

 1. As a student, you can be notified of all ***relevant job openings*** so that your seniors can apply for them.
 2. Appearing candidates will be able to track application status in one user profile, which will include essential features such as ***projects***, ***proof-of-work***, ***various social*** and ***technical profiles***, and so on.
 3. As a Placement Incharge, students can select a category for themselves from ***product-based***, ***service-based***, or ***start-up***.
 4. An individual who selects a specific domain should be screened based on the ***domain*** he or she selects.
